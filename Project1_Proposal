# 6. Gameplay
Mechanics:
Like the normal puzzle-horror game. The player needs to find the keys to escape from the house. In 100 times of mouse click.

# Control:
Mouse Clicked

# New user experience:
The only commander is the mouse click. Therefore no new user experience needs to be taught.

# Player Learning:
In order to find all the keys, the player needs to be careful. Also, the players should notice the mouse click times are limited by themselves if the player clicks a lot, he/she will die.
